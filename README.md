##### Testing techniques and practices used:

* Set, Get and test an element content (gamepanel.component.spec.ts => setCellSign)

* Inject a service & using a service stub (gamepanel.component.spec.ts)

* Test component navigation by injecting an application router & using router stub (gamestart.component.spec.ts)

* Test if a component method was executed (gamestart.component.spec.ts)

* Test binding (gamestart.component.spec.ts => Test input <-> player bindings)
